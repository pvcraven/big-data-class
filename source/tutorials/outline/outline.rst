Tutorial: Outlining
===================

Using an outline can save you time. Too many people skip outlining because they
think it will cost them time. If it costs you time, you are doing it wrong.

Here's a way to do it:

Step 1: Create an outline-outline
---------------------------------

Here's an outline you can start with for *every* paper.

* Introduction
    * Thesis
* Background information
* # words in paper / 20 = # outline points.
* Conclusion

Great! Now we just need to fill out that outline.

Step 2: Start the outline
-------------------------

Next, put together a thesis. You'll likely revise it, but get a start.

Also, list out the background information your paper will need to tell the reader.

* Introduction
    * Thesis: The threats that face cyber security have been helped and hindered by big data.
* Background information
    * What is big data?
    * What is cyber security?
* 20 points
* Conclusion

Step 3: Start filling out the outline
-------------------------------------

* Introduction
    * Thesis: The threats that face cyber security have been helped and hindered by big data.
* Background information
    * What is big data?
    * What is cyber security?
* Business (8 points)
* Government (7 points)
* Individual security (5 points)
* Conclusion

Step 4: More detail
-------------------

Start filling in those points

* Introduction
    * Thesis: The threats that face cyber-security have been helped and hindered by big data.
* Background information
    * What is big data?
    * What is cyber-security?
* Business
    * Government has more services on-line
    * Protecting against cyber-espionage is now a thing
    * Protect infrastructure
        * Power
        * Water
        * Communications
        * Nuclear
    * etc.
* Government (Go ahead and list these now)
* Individual security (Go ahead and list these now)
* Conclusion (Do nothing here yet)

Step 5: Add in citations
------------------------

Put in where you will use citations

* Introduction
    * Thesis: The threats that face cyber security have been helped and hindered by big data.
* Background information
    * What is big data? (Smith, 2012)
    * What is cyber security? (Whedon, 2014)
* Business
    * Government has more services on-line
    * Protecting against cyber-espionage is now a thing
    * Protect infrastructure (Giles, 2014)
        * Power
        * Water
        * Communications
        * Nuclear
    * etc.
* (etc)
* Conclusion

Step 6: Order everything
------------------------

Spend time moving things around. Get things in the best possible order.

Make sure no point contradicts your thesis. If you have a lot of points
contradicting your thesis, maybe revise the thesis?

Step 7: Write your conclusion
-----------------------------

Write your conclusion. Talk about how your points support the thesis.

Avoid these mistakes:
    * Do not simply restate your thesis. Again, show how your data/arguments
      support your thesis.
    * Do not introduce anything new in the conclusion. This is not a good time
      for "But wait! There's more!"

Revise your thesis. Go back and spend time revising your thesis so that is
fits with your whole paper.
