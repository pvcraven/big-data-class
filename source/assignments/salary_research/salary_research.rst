Assignment 9: Salary Research Essay
===================================

Take a look at the PayScale Research Site

Look at two careers you might be interested in. Write an essay on the data that you see on the site. Feel free to cut/paste images (ask how to use the 'snip' tool if you need) to help your essay.

What is the median salary? What is the range? What about bonus?
How do the two jobs compare in salary?
How does the location and experience affect the salary?
What are the common "career paths" for the job(s) you are interested in?
How many survey responses were part of the salary figures?
What other interesting facts/figures are there about the job?
