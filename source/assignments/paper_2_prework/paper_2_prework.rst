Assignment 7: Big Data Paper 2 Pre-work
=======================================

This is the research for the second report. You need to turn in:

* Initial data analysis (in MS Word format)
* An outline
* A bibliography
* Supporting Excel files

You can turn in the analysis, outline, and bibliography as one document.

The goal for the paper will be take some of the big data analysis
techniques we learned, and apply them to learn something new.

Do not talk about what you could do. Actually do it. This has been the most
frequent mistake made in the years past. Don't say "From this, we could
determine what players we need to cut from our team." Instead say, "Because
of x, y, and z, we should cut Bob, Fred, and George."

The final paper should have the following parts:

* Introduction
    * Because of the nature of this report, the main topic will be
      the processing of the data and its analysis. You may have one analysis on
      football and another analysis on smoking in this report. Or you could do both
      on football. Your goal is to show
      the reader what you can do with the data. Write your introduction accordingly.
* Text Processing
	* Search up something out of the text files.
	* Describe what you are doing for processing, and how you are doing it.
	* Talk very specifically about the results.
	* If you want, you can feed this data into the graph and/or pivot table.
* Graph
	* Graph the data.
	* Label your x and y axis. Give the graph a title.
	* Describe in detail what this graph is showing. Don't just graph some random
	  thing. Graph data that is informative.
	* Then describe why it matters, and what exactly you can derive from that data.
* Pivot Table
	* Use a pivot table.
	* Make one or more pivot tables that inform the reader.
	* Specify how you created the table. Where you got the data from.
	* Tell why the data you are showing matters and what you can do with it.
* Conclusion
* Bibliography
* Also - Upload your supporting Excel files.
* The paper should have 1,000 words or more.

However, this part of the assignment is just the pre-work. For this assignment
I am looking for:

* Is the data analysis included in the outline? Make sure the data gets copied from your
  original sources into the MS Word document. I'll only look at the Word
  document, so if it only exists in an Excel document you won't get credit for it.
* Do you have a first version of your text processing?
* Do you have a first version of your pivot table?
* Do you have a first version of your graph?
* Do you have an outline showing what you will talk about?
* Do you show in the outline where you will cite items?
* Do you have at least one additional source that you've pulled into your outline discussion? (Not a raw data source.)
* Do you have a bibliography that cites the data that you used? And any other background info?s
