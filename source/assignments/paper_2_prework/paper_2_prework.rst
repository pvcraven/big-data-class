Assignment 6: Big Data Paper Pre-work
======================================

This is the second report. You will take some of the big data analysis
techniques we learned, and apply them to learn something new.

Do not talk about what you could do. Actually do it. This has been the most
frequent mistake made in the years past. Don't say "From this, we could
determine what players we need to cut from our team." Instead say, "Because
of x, y, and z, we should cut Bob, Fred, and George."

The paper should have the following parts:

* Introduction. Because of the nature of this report, the main topic will be
  the processing of the data and its analysis. You may have one analysis on
  football and another analysis on smoking in this report. Or you could do both
  on football. Your goal is to show
  the reader what you can do with the data. Write your introduction accordingly.
* Text Processing
  * Search up something out of the text files.
  * Describe what you are doing for processing, and how you are doing it.
  * Talk very specifically about the results.
  * If you want, you can feed this data into the graph and/or pivot table.
* Graph
  * Graph the data.
  * Describe in detail what this graph is showing. Don't just graph some random
    thing. Graph data that is informative.
  * Then describe why it matters, and what exactly you can derive from that data.
* Pivot Table
  * Use a pivot table.
  * Make one or more pivot tables that inform the reader.
  * Specify how you created the table. Where you got the data from.
  * Tell why the data you are showing matters and what you can do with it.
* Conclusion
* Bibliography
* Also - Upload your supporting Excel files.
* The paper should have 1,000 words or more.

This part of the assignment is the pre-work. I want to see some initial data
and an outline for the paper.
