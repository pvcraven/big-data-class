Assignment 11 - Paper 3 - Annotated Bibliography
================================================

Each person in your group should come up with at least three data sources for
your paper. These could be books, magazines, web articles, or raw data sources.
If you have three people in your group, then you should end up with a minimum
of nine data sources.

Coordinate with your group so that you don't have the same people researching the
same sources.

Remember - doing the "minimum" does not mean that you get an "A". To get an
A you need to do A work.

Each bibliography entry should provide:

* Citation
* Quick summary of the source material.
* How you could tie it into your paper. What does it have to do with the
  topic and how is it Big Data related?
* Quality of the material. Is it good?
* Reputation of the source. Does this come from a reputable source, like the
  U.S. Census Bureau, or does it come from some "unnamed source" on the web?
* Bias of the source. Does the source seemed biased? If it is just data, could
  there be sampling bias?

If you can't find enough source material, or if you can't solidly tie the
sources to your thesis and Big Data, then rethink your topic.
